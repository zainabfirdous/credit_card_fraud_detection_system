The unforeseen event of Covid-19 has led to many people embracing digital transactions and online shopping. This combined with other benefits provided by credit card issuers such as rewards has increased the usage of credit card, and in turn increased credit card frauds. Credit card default can have serious implications on credit card holder and can affect financial stability of credit card issuers. There is a need for a system that can predict defaults ahead of time so that appropriate measures can be taken by credit card issuers. In this project I have conducted a comparative analysis of various machine-learning algorithms often used in fraud detection such as logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier and support vector machine classifier. The models were compared on the basis of precision, recall and accuracy to find the best algorithm for predicting probable defaulters. 
These models were then deployed using jobLib to Django project, where a user can either predit for a single user or submit a csv file of multiple users and predit for all of them. A user can also view the algorithms performance using multi-user predict feature.
